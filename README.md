Hangman
=======

This is a school project made for the purpose of learn how to do testing through the development of some software.
The project is a game based on Hangman. The player will be able to guess a random word from a database, and/or register 
as a user. This will allow the user to add new words to the database and compare the time and lifes used to guess a word
with other users who guessed on that word.
